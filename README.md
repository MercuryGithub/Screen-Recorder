# Python Screen Recorder

This is a basic screen recorder using python.
You can set the size/area/region of screen that is to be recorded.
The recording is done in mp4 format.
After a few modifications, we can also record audio (using pyadio library).
We can set a cut-off/hot-key to stop recording.
